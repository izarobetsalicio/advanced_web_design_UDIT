            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Ocean Lovers Guide to Compost is an educational website that
              blends visual storytelling, environmental awareness, and
              interactive design with the intention of inspiring sustainable
              actions. This site was selected for its storytelling, immersive
              design and enjoyable user experience. It uses beautiful
              illustrated elements to turn a niche topic like compost into
              something visually interesting that connects personal habits to
              global ocean health.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The initial impression is really nice, since the site feels
              inviting and optimistic as well as purposeful. It is very well
              designed and immediately communicates a sense of environmental
              concern and empowerment. The tone is warm, and accessible, which
              makes the sustainability topic feel achievable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              The site uses a narrative-driven layout that unfolds like a story,
              guiding users step by step through the composting cycle. Each
              section is clearly defined using color changes, bold headings, and
              illustrations. Navigation is minimal, relying mainly on scrolling
              and anchor links for linear exploration.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Visually, the design combines earthy tones with oceanic blues and
              vibrant accents like red and yellow. A bold, friendly sans-serif
              font ensures readability and consistency, while a lighter
              sans-serif supports longer texts. This typographic pairing creates
              a clear visual hierarchy and reinforces the site's cohesive,
              branded aesthetic.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
              The interactive elements of the web are composed of different
              animations, microinteractions and different effects. The scroll
              transitions are smooth and there are a series of fade-ins that
              enhance the storytelling factor. Some examples of this are moving
              backgrounds that resemble water, animated texts that appear, and
              carrousels. When it comes to microinteractions, there are hover
              effects, images that scale up and buttons that take you to
              different pages. These elements make the web really engaging by
              having constant movement and transitions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              The site stands out for its clarity, using simple language and
              well-structured sections to guide users through composting
              concepts. Its narrative tone makes the topic approachable and
              engaging, especially for beginners. While the visual design is
              clean and modern, there is a noticeable lack of accessibility
              features such as alt text for images, keyboard navigation support,
              and screen reader compatibility. Enhancing these elements would be
              essential to ensure an inclusive experience. Built on the Framer
              platform, the site can be resource-intensive, which may affect
              loading times on lower-end devices. Implementing lazy loading and
              optimizing image assets could significantly improve performance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
              The site is visually engaging
              and responsive, but technical aspects reveal areas for improvement.
              W3C Validator shows clean syntax but limited semantic structure,
              missing tags like the section and article that aid accessibility
              and SEO. Google Lighthouse flags performance concerns due to heavy
              animations and large assets, with potential issues in Core Web
              Vitals. 
              PageSpeed suggest optimizing images and enabling lazy
              loading to boost speed. Search Console and Semrush point to
              minimal metadata and weak indexing structure. Additional checks
              confirm no broken links, clean syntax via HTMLHint, and mobile
              responsiveness, though animation-heavy sections may lag on older
              devices. Overall, the site excels in design but would benefit from
              semantic HTML, performance tuning, and stronger accessibility and
              SEO practices.

        <p>
          The Ocean Lovers Guide to Compost excels in storytelling and visual design, making composting feel inspiring and approachable. To reach full excellence, it should improve accessibility, semantic structure, and technical performance for a more inclusive and robust experience. These enhancements would not only broaden its audience but also reinforce its environmental mission. By aligning technical precision with its creative vision, the site can become a benchmark for sustainable web design.

            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Maggie App website is an informative platform that describes the purpose of the app, which claims to make parenthood easier through the proposal of different activities and organized schedules. The aim of the website is to show the user the benefits and characteristics of the app, by following a very friendly and cute interactive design that appeals to both the parents and the kids.
            </p>
            <br />

              The Maggie App website is an informative platform that describes the purpose of the app, which claims to make parenthood easier through the proposal of different activities and organized schedules. The aim of the website is to show the user the benefits and characteristics of the app, by following a very friendly and cute interactive design that appeals to both the parents and the kids.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              This website follows a webbed structure, in which the home is the most relevant but all the other additional pages are displayed in an equal way. This means that you can access all pages from any point of the website, and that the home page is the one that includes the most important information when it comes to the app's behaviour. Navigating the website is easy and intuitive, since it has a static header with the additional pages, and the rest of the web is explored by scrolling.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As previously mentioned, the design is composed of pastel colors and large geometric illustrated elements. These illustrations, although simple, give the website a friendly environment. On top of this, the design includes real photographs and combines them with thick borders to maintain a coherence across the web. The bold typography is very bold and has a lot of visual weight to it that catches the user's attention immediately. To balance this, there are two other typographies in use; the first one is a sans-serif font that is used to add information on a main topic, and the other one is a hand-written font that has a more decorative purpose (considering it is used for more irrelevant text). Overall the visual design is very curated and professional, with a cohesive color palette and photography/illustration style. This gives the user confidence and, as a result, they are more likely to get the app.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
             The interactive elements of the website are subtle but effective. Scroll transitions are smooth, and hover effects on buttons and cards provide visual feedback. The call-to-action buttons are clearly marked and lead users to download the app or explore activities. While the site doesn't rely on heavy animations, its simplicity supports the goal of reducing cognitive load for busy parents.Microinteractions include clickable cards, responsive layout shifts, and hover highlights. These elements maintain engagement without overwhelming the user. The interaction design is gentle and purposeful, aligning with the supportive and calming tone of the site.

            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Usability is one of the strongest aspects of the Maggie App website. The language is simple, empathetic, and direct, making it accessible to a wide audience. The structure is clear, and the calls to action are easy to follow. However, accessibility features are limited—there's no visible alt text for images, and keyboard navigation is not fully supported. Improving these areas would make the site more inclusive and user-friendly.

            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
              Technically, the site is clean but basic. HTML syntax is valid, though semantic tags like section and article are underused, which affects accessibility and SEO. Google Lighthouse reports good mobile responsiveness but flags minor performance issues due to unoptimized assets. PageSpeed Insights recommends compressing images and enabling lazy loading.Search engine indexing is limited, with minimal metadata and weak keyword structure. There are no broken links, and the site passes HTMLHint checks. Overall, the technical foundation is solid but would benefit from semantic improvements and SEO enhancements.

          <div class="text-column">
            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Alfredo Gelado website is a promotional platform for a Portuguese ice cream brand that blends playful branding with a bold, contemporary aesthetic. It was selected for its vibrant visual identity, immersive layout, and strong personality-driven storytelling. The site aims to communicate the brand's irreverent tone and artisanal quality through expressive design and cheeky copywriting.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The initial impression is striking and memorable. The homepage greets users with oversized typography, animated transitions, and bold color contrasts that immediately convey a sense of fun and rebellion. While the tone is humorous and slightly provocative, the design feels polished and intentional. The combination of editorial-style layouts and expressive illustrations makes the site feel like a lifestyle magazine rather than a typical product page.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              The site follows a linear scroll-based structure with anchor-linked sections and minimal navigation. The homepage acts as a dynamic storytelling space, introducing the brand's philosophy, flavors, and visual identity. Additional pages like “Manifesto” and “Sabores” are accessible via a fixed header, maintaining continuity across the site.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Visually, the design is bold and graphic. The color palette mixes deep reds, blacks, and creams with occasional neon accents, creating a dramatic and high-contrast atmosphere. Typography plays a central role: oversized, condensed sans-serif fonts dominate the layout, paired with playful handwritten elements and expressive type treatments. The illustrations are stylized and surreal, often paired with photographic textures and collage-like compositions. This visual language reinforces the brand's rebellious and artistic tone, making the site feel curated and editorial.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
              The interactive design is dynamic and theatrical. Scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects, and hover transitions create a sense of movement and surprise. Text blocks animate into view, images shift and scale, and buttons respond with playful microinteractions. These elements enhance the storytelling and keep users engaged throughout the experience.The site also includes animated backgrounds, layered transitions, and interactive flavor cards that respond to hover and click. While the interactions are visually rich, they remain intuitive and responsive, supporting the brand's energetic personality without overwhelming the user.

            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Usability is well-considered from a visual and experiential standpoint, but accessibility could be improved. The site uses clear visual hierarchy and consistent layout patterns, making navigation straightforward. However, the heavy use of animations and lack of alt text or keyboard navigation support may hinder access for users with disabilities.Performance is generally smooth on modern devices, but the animation-heavy design and large assets could cause lag on older hardware. Implementing lazy loading and optimizing image formats would improve speed and responsiveness.

            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
             Technically, the site is well-crafted but leans heavily on visual impact over semantic structure. HTML syntax is clean, but semantic tags like section and article are underused, which affects SEO and screen reader compatibility. Google Lighthouse flags performance issues related to large assets and animation complexity. PageSpeed Insights recommends compressing images and reducing layout shifts.Search indexing is limited due to minimal metadata and unconventional structure. There are no broken links, and mobile responsiveness is solid, though animation-heavy sections may load slowly.

            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Pictoric website is a cultural and artistic platform dedicated to Ukrainian illustration. It was selected for its strong conceptual identity, editorial layout, and its role in promoting visual storytelling during times of social and political urgency. The site blends design, activism, and heritage, showcasing illustration as both a creative and communicative tool.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The initial impression is poetic and powerful. The homepage greets users with bold statements like “Even in dark times there is light,” immediately setting a tone of resilience and hope. The design feels curated and expressive, with a balance between minimalism and emotional depth. The use of large type, muted colors, and layered visuals creates a contemplative atmosphere that invites exploration.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              The site follows a modular structure, with each project or exhibition presented as a standalone block within a scrollable layout. Navigation is minimal, relying on anchor links and a fixed header that includes sections like “Projects,” “About Us,” and “Boutique.” The homepage acts as a curated gallery, guiding users through thematic collections and featured works.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Visually, the design is understated yet rich. The color palette is composed of soft neutrals, with accents of yellow and blue referencing the Ukrainian flag. Typography is clean and editorial, using a modern sans-serif for body text and bold headings to create hierarchy. The illustrations vary in style but are unified by their cultural relevance and emotional tone. Real photographs are used sparingly, often integrated into collage-like compositions that enhance the storytelling. The overall aesthetic is thoughtful and respectful, allowing the artwork to speak for itself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
              Interactive elements are subtle and functional. Scroll-based transitions guide users through the site, with hover effects on project thumbnails and clickable cards leading to detailed views. There are no heavy animations, which supports the contemplative tone of the site. Instead, the interaction design focuses on clarity and accessibility. Microinteractions include hover highlights, responsive layout shifts, and smooth anchor navigation. These elements maintain engagement while preserving the editorial feel.

            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              Usability is strong, with clear structure and intuitive navigation. The language is concise and informative, making the site accessible to a broad audience. However, accessibility features are limited—there's no visible alt text for images, and keyboard navigation is not fully supported. Enhancing these elements would improve inclusivity, especially given the site's educational and cultural mission. Performance is generally smooth, but some sections could benefit from lazy loading and image optimization. The site is lightweight and responsive, but further tuning could enhance mobile performance and reduce load times for image-heavy pages.

            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
              Technically, the site is clean but could benefit from semantic improvements. HTML syntax is valid, but semantic tags like section and article are underused, which affects SEO and screen reader compatibility. Google Lighthouse flags minor performance issues due to large assets and layout shifts. PageSpeed Insights recommends compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Search indexing is limited, with minimal metadata and weak keyword structure. There are no broken links, and mobile responsiveness is solid. Overall, the site is technically sound but would benefit from stronger semantic structure and accessibility enhancements.

          Pictoric excels in presenting illustration as a form of cultural expression and social commentary. Its editorial design and thematic depth make it a powerful platform for Ukrainian artists and storytellers. To reach full excellence, the site should improve accessibility, semantic structure, and performance. These refinements would broaden its reach and reinforce its mission of making illustration visible, meaningful, and transformative.
