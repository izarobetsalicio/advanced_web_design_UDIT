            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Ocean Lovers Guide to Compost is an educational website that
              blends visual storytelling, environmental awareness, and
              interactive design with the intention of inspiring sustainable
              actions. This site was selected for its storytelling, immersive
              design and enjoyable user experience. It uses beautiful
              illustrated elements to turn a niche topic like compost into
              something visually interesting that connects personal habits to
              global ocean health.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The initial impression is really nice, since the site feels
              inviting and optimistic as well as purposeful. It is very well
              designed and immediately communicates a sense of environmental
              concern and empowerment. The tone is warm, and accessible, which
              makes the sustainability topic feel achievable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              The site uses a narrative-driven layout that unfolds like a story,
              guiding users step by step through the composting cycle. Each
              section is clearly defined using color changes, bold headings, and
              illustrations. Navigation is minimal, relying mainly on scrolling
              and anchor links for linear exploration.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Visually, the design combines earthy tones with oceanic blues and
              vibrant accents like red and yellow. A bold, friendly sans-serif
              font ensures readability and consistency, while a lighter
              sans-serif supports longer texts. This typographic pairing creates
              a clear visual hierarchy and reinforces the site's cohesive,
              branded aesthetic.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
              The interactive elements of the web are composed of different
              animations, microinteractions and different effects. The scroll
              transitions are smooth and there are a series of fade-ins that
              enhance the storytelling factor. Some examples of this are moving
              backgrounds that resemble water, animated texts that appear, and
              carrousels. When it comes to microinteractions, there are hover
              effects, images that scale up and buttons that take you to
              different pages. These elements make the web really engaging by
              having constant movement and transitions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              The site stands out for its clarity, using simple language and
              well-structured sections to guide users through composting
              concepts. Its narrative tone makes the topic approachable and
              engaging, especially for beginners. While the visual design is
              clean and modern, there is a noticeable lack of accessibility
              features such as alt text for images, keyboard navigation support,
              and screen reader compatibility. Enhancing these elements would be
              essential to ensure an inclusive experience. Built on the Framer
              platform, the site can be resource-intensive, which may affect
              loading times on lower-end devices. Implementing lazy loading and
              optimizing image assets could significantly improve performance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
              The site is visually engaging
              and responsive, but technical aspects reveal areas for improvement.
              W3C Validator shows clean syntax but limited semantic structure,
              missing tags like the section and article that aid accessibility
              and SEO. Google Lighthouse flags performance concerns due to heavy
              animations and large assets, with potential issues in Core Web
              Vitals. 
              PageSpeed suggest optimizing images and enabling lazy
              loading to boost speed. Search Console and Semrush point to
              minimal metadata and weak indexing structure. Additional checks
              confirm no broken links, clean syntax via HTMLHint, and mobile
              responsiveness, though animation-heavy sections may lag on older
              devices. Overall, the site excels in design but would benefit from
              semantic HTML, performance tuning, and stronger accessibility and
              SEO practices.

        <p>
          The site's strengths lie in its engaging storytelling, clear
          environmental message, and well-structured educational content.
          Thoughtful design choices—like a scroll-based layout, earthy color
          palette, and friendly typography—create a cohesive and inviting
          experience. However, limited accessibility, performance concerns on
          slower devices, and minimal semantic markup affect usability and
          reach. Key takeaways: strong narratives elevate learning, technical
          excellence ensures broader access, and design must balance creativity
          with inclusivity.

            <h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
            <p>
              The interactive elements of the web are composed of different
              animations, microinteractions and different effects. The scroll
              transitions are smooth and there are a series of fade-ins that
              enhance the storytelling factor. Some examples of this are moving
              backgrounds that resemble water, animated texts that appear, and
              carrousels. When it comes to microinteractions, there are hover
              effects, images that scale up and buttons that take you to
              different pages. These elements make the web really engaging by
              having constant movement and transitions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>4. Usability</h3>
            <p>
              The site stands out for its clarity, using simple language and
              well-structured sections to guide users through composting
              concepts. Its narrative tone makes the topic approachable and
              engaging, especially for beginners. While the visual design is
              clean and modern, there is a noticeable lack of accessibility
              features such as alt text for images, keyboard navigation support,
              and screen reader compatibility. Enhancing these elements would be
              essential to ensure an inclusive experience. Built on the Framer
              platform, the site can be resource-intensive, which may affect
              loading times on lower-end devices. Implementing lazy loading and
              optimizing image assets could significantly improve performance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>5. Technical Aspects</h3>
            <p>
              The site is visually engaging
              and responsive, but technical aspects reveal areas for improvement.
              W3C Validator shows clean syntax but limited semantic structure,
              missing tags like the section and article that aid accessibility
              and SEO. Google Lighthouse flags performance concerns due to heavy
              animations and large assets, with potential issues in Core Web
              Vitals. 
              PageSpeed suggest optimizing images and enabling lazy
              loading to boost speed. Search Console and Semrush point to
              minimal metadata and weak indexing structure. Additional checks
              confirm no broken links, clean syntax via HTMLHint, and mobile
              responsiveness, though animation-heavy sections may lag on older
              devices. Overall, the site excels in design but would benefit from
              semantic HTML, performance tuning, and stronger accessibility and
              SEO practices.

        <p>
          The site's strengths lie in its engaging storytelling, clear
          environmental message, and well-structured educational content.
          Thoughtful design choices—like a scroll-based layout, earthy color
          palette, and friendly typography—create a cohesive and inviting
          experience. However, limited accessibility, performance concerns on
          slower devices, and minimal semantic markup affect usability and
          reach. Key takeaways: strong narratives elevate learning, technical
          excellence ensures broader access, and design must balance creativity
          with inclusivity.

            <h3>1. The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
            <p>
              The Ocean Lovers Guide to Compost is an educational website that
              blends visual storytelling, environmental awareness, and
              interactive design with the intention of inspiring sustainable
              actions. This site was selected for its storytelling, immersive
              design and enjoyable user experience. It uses beautiful
              illustrated elements to turn a niche topic like compost into
              something visually interesting that connects personal habits to
              global ocean health.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The initial impression is really nice, since the site feels
              inviting and optimistic as well as purposeful. It is very well
              designed and immediately communicates a sense of environmental
              concern and empowerment. The tone is warm, and accessible, which
              makes the sustainability topic feel achievable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>2. Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
            <p>
              The site uses a narrative-driven layout that unfolds like a story,
              guiding users step by step through the composting cycle. Each
              section is clearly defined using color changes, bold headings, and
              illustrations. Navigation is minimal, relying mainly on scrolling
              and anchor links for linear exploration.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Visually, the design combines earthy tones with oceanic blues and
              vibrant accents like red and yellow. A bold, friendly sans-serif
              font ensures readability and consistency, while a lighter
              sans-serif supports longer texts. This typographic pairing creates
              a clear visual hierarchy and reinforces the site's cohesive,
              branded aesthetic.
