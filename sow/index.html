        <h3>1.The Selection and Initial Impressions</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>Ocean Lovers Guide to Compost</b> is an educational website
          that blends visual storytelling, environmental awareness, and
          interactive design with the intention of inspiring sustainable
          actions. This site was selected for its storytelling, immersive design
          and enjoyable user experience. It uses beautiful illustrated elements
          to turn a niche topic like compost into something visually interesting
          that connects personal habits to global ocean health.
        </p>

	</div>
	
        <p>
          The initial impression is really nice, since the site feels inviting
          and optimistic as well as purposeful. It is very well designed and
          immediately communicates a sense of environmental concern and
          empowerment. The tone is war, and accessible, which makes the
          sustainability topic feel achievable.

        <h3>2.Web Structure and Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
          The web follows a narrative-driven layout, which means that the site
          unfolds like a story. The users are guided through the steps and
          importance of the composting cycle step by step. There are clear
          divisions in between the different sections of each phase, which is
          achieved by the change in colors, bold titles, and illustrative
          elements. Furthermore, the navigation is minimal and simple, the main
          user action is the scroll, and then there is also a linear exploration
          that allows the user to jump to other pages via anchor links.
		</p>
		<p>
			The visual design is key when it comes to a web design, especially if the information needs to be both cohesive and distinguishable. In this case, the main color palette is composed of earthy tones -with oceanic blues and greens- as well as more vivid colors such as red and yelow. When talking about the typography, the main one is a friendly sans-serif font. The bold characteristic of the type allows for great readability and consistency across the web. The use of this font across the whole page creates a sort of branding, that is reinforced with the illustration style, icons and colors. There is another typography used, a simple sans-serif that has a smaller visual weight and that is used for the more extense, descriptive texts in order for them to be readable. The combination os the two creates a visual hierarchy where the user can easily identify the different sections and stop to read.
